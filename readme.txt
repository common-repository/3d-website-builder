demo :

[3D Website Builder Live Demo ](https://3dwebsitebuilder.com/demo/)


All demos and other pages of the https://3dwebsitebuilder.com website were designed only with this plugin and free twentytwentyfour theme.


Years ago we came to the conclusion that page builders
And sliders no longer meet the needs of the web world.
So, we started coding a plugin called 3D Website Builder that, 
in addition to the ideas Well used in page builders and sliders uses new ideas.
In fact, this plugin is neither a page builder nor a slider.
Rather, it is a new generation of plug-ins that only works with JavaScript. 
It has a new responsive system and indirectly controls CPU and GPU 
consumption on page objects with scrolling and time consumption.
No need for Bootstrap and JQuery. It is very light and fast.
   has good ideas such as event-act system, effect design system,
Color tables and dynamic CSS and... that some ideas are active in this version
and others in the pro version.
There are 14 modules in this version. Pro version
It currently has 56 modules. We try to add new modules every week. 
You can add them to the plugin by clicking a button (pro version).
We hope to add at least 1 of each type of module before the end of the year.
Even large modules that need to create a dedicated table, such as reservations,
appointment, menu, form and...
You can download the pro version from our website without payment and use some of its features
without any payment.
Soon, by adding new features to the plugin, we will add more features (without any payment) in two versions
We believe that the best designs are only possible with the new method used in this plugin
